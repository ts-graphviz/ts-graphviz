# @ts-graphviz/core

This package contains the core implementation of models and functions provided to users for the ts-graphviz library.

It is part of the ts-graphviz library, which is split into modular packages to improve maintainability, flexibility, and ease of use.

## Features

- Graph, Node, and Edge model implementations
- High-level APIs for creating and manipulating DOT language elements
- Extensible design for custom implementations

## Usage

Import the necessary classes and functions from the @ts-graphviz/core package:

```ts
import { Graph, Node, Edge } from '@ts-graphviz/core';
```

Use the imported items in your project to create and manipulate DOT language elements:

```ts
const graph = new Graph('G');
const nodeA = new Node('A', { label: 'Node A' });
const nodeB = new Node('B', { label: 'Node B' });
const edge = new Edge([nodeA, nodeB], { label: 'A -> B' });

graph.addNode(nodeA);
graph.addNode(nodeB);
graph.addEdge(edge);

console.log(graph.toDot());
```

For more examples and usage details, please refer to the ts-graphviz documentation.
