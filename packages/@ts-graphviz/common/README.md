# @ts-graphviz/common

This package contains type information, constants, and utility functions related to the DOT language attributes, attribute values, and models for ts-graphviz.

It is part of the ts-graphviz library, which is split into modular packages to improve maintainability, flexibility, and ease of use.

## Features

- Type definitions for DOT language elements, such as attributes and attribute values
- Constants representing common attribute names and values
- Utility functions for working with DOT language elements

## Usage

Import the necessary types, constants, or utility functions from the `@ts-graphviz/common` package:

```ts
import { NodeAttributesObject, EdgeAttributesObject } from '@ts-graphviz/common';
```

Use the imported items in your project to work with the DOT language elements:


```ts
const nodeAttr: NodeAttributesObject = {
  label: 'Node label',
  shape: 'ellipse',
};

const edgeAttr: EdgeAttributesObject = {
  label: 'Edge label',
  color: 'red',
};
```

For more examples and usage details, please refer to the ts-graphviz documentation.
