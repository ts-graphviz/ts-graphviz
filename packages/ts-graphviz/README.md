# ts-graphviz

ts-graphviz is a TypeScript library for working with Graphviz DOT language, providing a modular and extensible way to create, manipulate, and render graph data.

It is split into several packages to improve maintainability, flexibility, and ease of use.

## Features

- Create and manipulate graphs, nodes, and edges using an object-oriented API
- Parse and generate DOT language with AST
- Adapter function implementations for various environments, such as Node.js Deno, and browser(not implemented)
- Extensible design for custom functionality
- Type definitions for DOT language elements
