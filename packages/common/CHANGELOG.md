## 3.0.3

### Patch Changes

- [#1513](https://github.com/ts-graphviz/ts-graphviz/pull/1513) [`9d52d28`](https://github.com/ts-graphviz/ts-graphviz/commit/9d52d282031ed173a75ef0fb77ddea9677f78520) Thanks [@kamiazya](https://github.com/kamiazya)! - Fix @next tag publishing pipeline to prevent incorrect releases

  This fix addresses issues with the @next tag publishing workflow where stable versions were incorrectly published with @next tag, and subsequently, @next versions stopped being published entirely.

  **Problem 1 (PR #1513):**
  Stable package versions were being incorrectly published with the @next tag instead of the latest tag. The Changesets action switches to `changeset-release/main` and updates package.json versions, but the @next publish step would run on this branch where no unreleased changesets remain, causing stable versions to be published with @next tag.

  **Solution 1:**
  Added a branch check step to verify the current working directory is on the main branch before executing @next publish.

  **Problem 2 (This PR):**
  The branch check from PR #1513 prevented ALL @next publishes because the changesets action never switches back to main, causing the branch check to always fail.

  **Solution 2:**
  Added a step to switch back to the main branch after the changesets action completes. This ensures the working directory is in the correct state for snapshot versioning while maintaining the safety check.

  **Changes:**

  - Added branch check to verify current branch before @next publish
  - Added `git checkout main` step after changesets action
  - Updated @next publish condition to include branch verification
  - Removed redundant commit message check that was ineffective

- [#1514](https://github.com/ts-graphviz/ts-graphviz/pull/1514) [`d74172a`](https://github.com/ts-graphviz/ts-graphviz/commit/d74172a594531f071b7e06c079b6555d867bf683) Thanks [@kamiazya](https://github.com/kamiazya)! - Migrate npm publishing to OIDC trusted publishing

  This change migrates the npm publishing workflow from using long-lived NPM_TOKEN secrets to OIDC (OpenID Connect) trusted publishing, following GitHub's security recommendations announced in September 2025.

  **Benefits:**

  - Enhanced security: No more long-lived tokens to manage, rotate, or accidentally expose
  - Automatic provenance: Provenance attestations are generated automatically without the --provenance flag
  - Compliance: Aligns with npm's new authentication requirements (token expiration limits)
  - Short-lived credentials: Each publish uses workflow-specific, ephemeral credentials

  **Changes:**

  - Added `environment: npm` to the release job to match trusted publisher configuration
  - Upgraded npm CLI to latest version (â‰¥11.5.1) for OIDC support
  - Removed NPM_TOKEN from changesets action and snapshot publish steps
  - Removed manual .npmrc creation as authentication now uses OIDC tokens
  - Updated id-token permission comment to reflect OIDC usage

  **Requirements:**

  - npm CLI v11.5.1 or later (automatically installed in workflow)
  - Trusted publisher configured for each package on npmjs.com
  - GitHub Actions environment named "npm" configured for the repository

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#1363](https://github.com/ts-graphviz/ts-graphviz/pull/1363) [`9328563`](https://github.com/ts-graphviz/ts-graphviz/commit/932856396ed0dede1dfc6737344a628f9667d07c) Thanks [@kamiazya](https://github.com/kamiazya)! - ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes: Drop Node.js 18 support

  Minimum required version is now Node.js 20+

  ### ESM-Only Distribution

  - **Remove CommonJS builds**: All packages now distribute only ESM (ECMAScript Modules)
  - **Package exports**: Removed `require` fields from `package.json` exports
  - **Module type**: All packages are now `"type": "module"`

  ## ðŸ”„ Migration Guide

  ### For ESM Projects (Recommended)

  ```json
  {
    "type": "module"
  }
  ```

  ```typescript
  // Import syntax remains unchanged
  import { Digraph, Node, Edge, toDot } from "ts-graphviz";
  import { toFile } from "ts-graphviz/adapter";
  import { parse } from "ts-graphviz/ast";
  ```

  ### For CommonJS Projects

  If you are using CommonJS (CJS) and need to migrate to ESM, you will need to update your project to support dynamic imports. This is necessary because the packages no longer provide CommonJS builds.

  ### Before (CJS)

  ```javascript
  // JavaScript (CommonJS)
  function createGraph() {
    // Dynamic import is required because the packages no longer provide CommonJS builds.
    const { Digraph, Node, Edge, toDot } = require("ts-graphviz");
    const graph = new Digraph();
    return toDot(graph);
  }
  ```

  ### After (ESM)

  ```javascript
  async function createGraph() {
    const { Digraph, Node, Edge, toDot } = await import("ts-graphviz");

    const graph = new Digraph();
    // Create your graph...
    return toDot(graph);
  }
  ```

  ```typescript
  // TypeScript (CommonJS)
  // Update tsconfig.json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "module": "Node16",
      "moduleResolution": "Node16"
    }
  }

  // Use dynamic imports
  async function createGraph() {
    const tsGraphviz = await import('ts-graphviz');
    const { Digraph, Node, Edge, toDot } = tsGraphviz;

    const graph = new Digraph();
    // Create your graph...
    return toDot(graph);
  }
  ```

  ## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

  - **Modern JavaScript**: Leveraging native ES modules for better performance
  - **Smaller bundle sizes**: ESM enables better tree-shaking
  - **Future-proof**: Aligning with the JavaScript ecosystem direction
  - **Better TypeScript support**: Enhanced module resolution

## 2.0.0

> It is part of the ts-graphviz library, which is split into modular packages to improve maintainability, flexibility, and ease of use.

This package contains type information, constants, and utility functions related to the DOT language attributes, attribute values, and models for ts-graphviz.

## Features

- Type definitions for DOT language elements, such as attributes and attribute values
- Constants representing common attribute names and values
- Utility functions for working with DOT language elements

## Usage

Import the necessary types, constants, or utility functions from the `@ts-graphviz/common` package:

```ts
import {
  NodeAttributesObject,
  EdgeAttributesObject,
} from "@ts-graphviz/common";
```

Use the imported items in your project to work with the DOT language elements:

```ts
const nodeAttr: NodeAttributesObject = {
  label: "Node label",
  shape: "ellipse",
};

const edgeAttr: EdgeAttributesObject = {
  label: "Edge label",
  color: "red",
};
```
