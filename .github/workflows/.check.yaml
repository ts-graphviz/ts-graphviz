  # Dependency Review Action
  #
  # This job will scan dependency manifest files that change as part of a Pull Request,
  # surfacing known-vulnerable versions of the packages declared or updated in the PR.
  # Once installed, if the workflow run is marked as required,
  # PRs introducing known-vulnerable packages will be blocked from merging.
